## What is a webhook and how are they used in Device42?

Webhooks are used to initiate an external action in another part of your IT environment when some "event", based on rules you define, occurs. Also known as _HTTP callbacks_, webhooks are "fired" at HTTP endpoints (URLs) when a configured "Webhook Action" criteria is met. Within Device42, anything that produces an audit-log entry can also be configured to "fire" a webhook.

For example, when a Device42 auto-discovery job finds a new device, when details about an existing device change, or when an existing device is deleted are three simple examples of actions that can be configured to trigger webhooks from Device42. An IT Administrator might configure a webhook to deliver a "message" to one or more IT employees via a webhook-compatible endpoint _(like Slack or Skype)_, letting them know that this action took place.

## Creating a webhook action in Device42

Configuring Device42 to send a webhook is a simple two-step process:

1. Define one or more **Webhook Endpoints:** the HTTP URLs Device42 should send your webhooks to via **Tools -> Webhooks -> Endpoints -> Add Webhook Endpoint**.

2. Define a **Webhook Action:** the Device42 action(s) that will trigger your webhook, and the endpoints they should go to via **Tools -> Webhooks -> Actions -> Add Webhook Actions**.
