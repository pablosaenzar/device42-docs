### Blade Slot Overview

Chassis Blade slots can be added to hardware models that have been designated Blade host / Chassis during creation.

Blade slots can be laid out on any ‘Blade host / Chassis’ hardware model during creation or while editing an existing hardware model.

### Add Blade Slots to Chassis

Add as many blade slots as needed to match the layout of your hardware. In the example below, the 5th half-height slot is being added (will be numbered #4) to the chassis being modeled:

### Adjust Layout on Existing Hardware Model

You can easily edit the layout of the slots after creation by clicking the “Model Layout” button on the hardware model.

### Using the Visual Model Editor

Click “Turn ON” to enable edit mode, and then drag and drop parts slots as desired. Slots that were created when the part model was defined will appear in the left column “Unmapped Existing Parts” and/or “Unmapped Existing Blade Slots”:

Click any parts or blade slot and click the “Edit” button on the lower left to reorient, rename, or to place a part into a parts slot:

_Note that editing a BLADE slot offers different options:_

When editing a blade slot, similar to a parts slot, you may add a number and/or change the orientation between horizontal and vertical. However, you can not put a part into a blade slot; you instead have the ability to set the blade height.

When you have finished editing your layout, simply “Save” the edits you made. You will see a green save confirmation in the upper left. You may now “Turn OFF” edit mode and your changes will remain saved:
