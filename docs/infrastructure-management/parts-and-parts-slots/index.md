Parts management was complete re-vamped in v15.04+. With many powerful new features, parts now play a larger role in Device42: Parts can now be inserted into parts slots, and parts themselves may also have ports. See the below documentation for more information!

To learn about **Parts Slots**, see [Device Parts Slots](infrastructure-management/devices/device-parts-slots.md) for a page dedicated to that topic.
