## View / Admin Running Discovery Jobs

### Jobs Dashboard Summary 

The Jobs Dashboard provides users actionable insight into running discovery jobs. Via the main menu, **Reports > Jobs Dashboard**, users can get an at-a-glance overview of Device42 Discovery Job Statuses, can deep-dive into each job for more details, and can even "kill" and/or delete a running job. 

The dashboard has three other sub-dashboards: **Completed Jobs**, **Queue Processing Stats**, and **Other Jobs Summary**. Refer to these sub-dashboard sections below for information on each.

The main screen of the Jobs Dashboard looks like this:

    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/jobs-dashboard-main-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

### Kill and Delete a Running or Hung Discovery Job

Check the box next to the job name(s) you want to kill, then select one of "Kill selected job(s)" options from the dropdown menu:

* The first "Allow Pending Jobs to Complete" option will terminate the ongoing discovery but will let any payloads in the queue finish processing. 
* The second "Remove Pending Jobs Immediately" option will terminate the ongoing discovery job and remove any payloads in the queue. If a discovery is half-finished when cancelled, it will be ended and no further devices will be added or updated. However, if timed correctly, there may be an edge case where payloads are dispatched to the MA after emptying the queue.

    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/jobs-dashboard-kill-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

## Sub-Dashboards

There are three other sub-dashboards available from the Jobs Summary page: "Completed Jobs", "Queue Processing Stats", and "Other Jobs Summary".

### Completed Jobs

The completed jobs page lists jobs that have run in the past and are no longer running. 

<ThemedImage

  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/jobs-dashboard-completed-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/jobs-dashboard-completed-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

**Delete or Export from Completed Jobs** Users are also able to delete a completed job from the Completed Jobs page, as well as export one or more items to a CSV. Check the box next to the line(s) you are interested in and choose your desired action from the "Action" dropdown menu. 

<ThemedImage
  alt="Completed Jobs actions"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/jobs-dashboard-export-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/jobs-dashboard-export-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

Next, click on the button with a 'gavel' icon to the right of the dropdown menu to execute the selected action.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Completed Jobs run action"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/jobs-dashboard-run-action-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/jobs-dashboard-run-action-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

### Queue Processing Stats

The queue processing stats sub-dashboard allows you to monitor the status of various queues within Device42. 

<ThemedImage
  alt="Queue Processing Stats page"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/jobs-dashboard-queue-processing-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/jobs-dashboard-queue-processing-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

### Other Jobs Summary

Jobs that don't utilize the main Jobs Dashboard will be found in the **Other Jobs Summary** sub-dashboard. Other jobs include RU (Resource Utilization) jobs, SP (Service Port) jobs, and vserver jobs. Job statuses can be monitored and you can also kill any running job from this page by selecting the checkbox next to it and choosing "Kill Selected Jobs" as your action. 

This is a sample of the "Other Jobs Summary" page:

    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/jobs-dashboard-other-jobs-dark.png'),
  }}
