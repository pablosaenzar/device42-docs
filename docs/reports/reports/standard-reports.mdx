From version 18.13.00, the traditional "Classic Reports" menu option has been renamed to **Standard Reports** under the **Analytics** menu. Standard Reports are generally the quickest and easiest way to query and report on information within Device42. 

The standard reporting feature is the first place to go to answer difficult business questions with system data. These reports integrate this powerful tabular reporting functionality with DOQL queries, MA object tables, and the catalog of existing reports.

Use the Standard Reporting options to create tabular reports directly from an existing report or from a list within the UI, or use a custom DOQL to retrieve and populate the data. These reports can then be exported or scheduled to email, providing recipients with data-rich tabular exports from the system that are easy to configure and digest.

## Creating a Standard Report

You can create a Standard Report in several ways:

- Using DOQL
- From a pre-defined report
- From a list page
- As a guided report

### Creating a Report Using DOQL

A DOQL statement, or Device42 Object Query Language statement, is a query that can be run against the Device42 database in the **Insights+** interface, through the application, or using the RESTful API. DOQLs can be used in Standard Reporting to generate the data to display in the results table.

**NOTE:** To create reports using DOQL, you should be familiar with and consult the data dictionary under the **Viewer Schema** option under the help icon.

To use DOQL to create or edit a Standard Report, name the report and then select **DOQL Query** from the report-type dropdown. Enter the DOQL commands in the text box. The start of a sample select statement is displayed in the DOQL text box. If an error is encountered during parsing (for example, due to invalid syntax or referencing a table or field that does not exist), an error message will show at the bottom of the text box.

### Creating a Report From a Pre-Defined Report

Create a multitab Standard Report with one tab containing the results of a previous existing report. Select the **Pre-Defined Report** option and choose from a set of existing reports to be included as a separate tab.

### Creating a Report From a Guided Report 

To build a Standard Report using the Guided Report option, select the model (like **Devices**), then select the table columns that are part of that device model. Field filters can be added or set to alter the result display of this report.

### Creating a Report From a List Page

You can create a new Standard Report from list pages. A Standard Report can be emailed and scheduled.

Create a Standard Report from Infrastructure list pages for:

- Rooms
- Racks
- Telco Circuits
- Parts Models
- Parts List
- Power Units
- Hardware Models
- Customers
- Departments
- Purchases
- Vendors 

Click the **Report** button at the top of the table.

Create a Standard Report from lists from the **Resources** menu for:

- All Devices
- All Assets
- Subnets
- All IP Addresses
- Ports
- Docker Resources
- LXC Resources
- Operating Systems
- Operating Systems in Use
- Software Components
- Software In Use
- Secrets 

First create and apply filters to a list, then create a Standard Report using the **Report** button at the top of the table.

Create a Standard Report from list pages under the **Applications** menu: 

- Application Components
- Certificates
- Certificate Instances

Create and apply filters to a list, then create a Standard Report using the **Report** button at the top of the table.

## Exporting Standard Reports 

As with the previous Classic Reports, you can view the report output on the screen or export the results in tab-separated values (TSV) or Excel formats.

## Scheduling Standard Reports

You can set and apply a schedule to the report, including a comma-separated list of recipients.
