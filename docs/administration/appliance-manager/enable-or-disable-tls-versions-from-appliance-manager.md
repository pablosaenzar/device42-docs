# Disabling or Enabling TLS versions from the Appliance Manager

Device42 allows you to restrict TLS versions for Appliance Manager Access. The radio buttons shown below control this feature.

**Note:** As of v16.23.00, all users will be upgraded to **TLS v1.2 by default** for the Appliance Manager and Device42. You can still change your setting to _Enable TLS v.1.1 and v1.2_ or _Enable All TLS_.

- To apply TLS version restrictions, log into the Device42 Appliance Manager by clicking the link at the bottom of the main login page, and enter your Device42 Appliance Manager credentials. The default username and password for the Appliance Manager is _d42admin/default_. ![](/assets/images/TLS-appliance-mgr-login.png)
- From the main menu on the left side of the Appliance Manager, select _Global Settings_ and then _TLS versions for Web Console_ orÂ _TLS versions for_ _Appliance Manager_.
- Select the appropriate radio button and click _Submit_ to apply your changes.
