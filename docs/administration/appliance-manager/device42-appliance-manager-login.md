## AWS Login 

For *marketplace* AWS installations, use `d42admin` as the username and your **AWS Instance ID** as the default password. See [the AWS installation instructions](https://docs.device42.com/getstarted/installation/installation-amazon-web-services/#accessing-the-d42-appliance-manager---aws-marketplace-installs) for more information.

If you *manually* installed AWS using a downloaded image, use the default Device42 username, `d42admin`, and password, `default`, to log into the Appliance Manager.
