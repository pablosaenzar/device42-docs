Device42 aims to support as many vendors as possible for SNMP-based discovery. Here's a list of vendors that we have verified support for.

Note that this list is not all-inclusive; it's intended to give a sense of the vendors that we support. 

Even if the vendor is not listed, discovery will generally still bring in some information even if your specific hardware has not yet been added. 

## Vendors that we've verified support for include:

## Adding support for non-verified vendors

Device42 is open to supporting as many vendors as possible for SNMP-based discovery. Should you happen to run across a device that isn't being discovered fully, or if you have hardware you'd like to see supported, simply go ahead and [generate an SNMPwalk of the device](administration/appliance-manager/collecting-snmpwalk-output-for-troubleshooting.md) in question by navigating to **Application > Generate SNMP Template** in your Appliance Manager.

Fill out the form and attach your MIB Files. Once this processes, select the standard data you're looking to have added. After you've completed this form, it will be routed to our engineers for inclusion!
