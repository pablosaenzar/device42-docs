## Introduction

Cloud Resources are items identified and returned by Device42 autodiscovery jobs and can be visualized in the resource map view. Information can be discovered and sorted by Cloud Vendor, Regions, Subnets, VPC (Virtual Private Cloud), and any other discovered resource types within your environments.

 

Note: While you can display Azure and GCP environments today in the resource map, AWS will display more accurate information at this time, but we are currently working to add the like-for-like functionality with all clouds, which will release in the near future.

## View Cloud Resources

Select _Infrastructure >_ Cloud Infrastructures from the Device42 menu to display the resources list.

Device42 displays the Cloud Infrastructure list page. You can search by name or filter the list by Cloud Account or by Cloud Vendor on this page.

Once you have selected the Cloud account you wish to view, you will be taken to the account overview. From here, you can select the resource map view to display the resource map for the account.

Once in the Resource Map view, you can navigate through the cloud environment, including navigating back up to the Cloud provider to view all accounts.

Below you can see that once you click on the account level/provider, it displays the additional cloud accounts within your environment.

We have also enabled the summary panel, which allows you to search by the resource's name to quickly identify your assets.

Additionally, below the search function in the summary panel, you will see the other filter options that are identified by resource type. For the example below, we use VPCs within this cloud environment, select VPCs, and then the resource map will not only bring those items up but highlight them for quick identification

If you want to drill down into the regions similar to the example below, then you will select the spyglass icon, next you will be able to focus on a particular region and have the ability to quickly identify the resources/assets within that region. You can expand as needed.

Another option within the regions is the ability to 'Show All'.

**Note:** Please keep in mind that large environments will need a few seconds to fully populate, so please be patient

Once expanded, you can see the resources within the region, and then a summary box displays important information such as Service Level, Last Change date/time, Resource Type, and Resource Category.

The 'Show All' view can be applied to all areas in the resource map, but please remember that large environments will take a few seconds to fully populate.
