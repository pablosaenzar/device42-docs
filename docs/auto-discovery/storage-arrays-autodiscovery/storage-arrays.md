## Introduction

Storage Arrays are identified and returned by Device42 [Storage Arrays autodiscovery](./). Storage Arrays also display their resource details, related resources, and topology map.

## View All Storage Arrays

Select _Resources > Storage > Arrays_ from the Device42 menu to display the storage arrays list.

Device42 displays the Storage Arrays list page. On this page, you can _Search by name_, or filter the list by _Type_.

**Note**: The Storage Arrays list page also includes an _Advanced Search_ option you can use to construct more specific searches. See the [Advanced Search Feature](/getstarted/advanced-search-feature.mdx) documentation page for instructions.

Click on an array _Name_ to see details about that array. You can use the links in the panel on the right to see details about that related resource.

### View Storage Arrays Mapped to Devices

Devices that have attached storage arrays display links to those arrays in the Parts tab of the device view page. The example below shows the Parts tab of a physical device with links to storage.
