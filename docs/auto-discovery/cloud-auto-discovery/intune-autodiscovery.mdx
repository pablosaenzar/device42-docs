## Intune Autodiscovery

[Microsoft Intune](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/fundamentals/what-is-intune) is a cloud-based service that focuses on mobile device management (MDM) and mobile application management (MAM). An organization can control how its devices are used, including mobile phones, tablets, and laptops, and configure specific policies to control applications.

Please use the following link to provide admin consent in the Azure portal for the Device42 discovery job:

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/grant-admin-consent

### Minimum Requirements

- Active Intune license on the tenant
- Grant admin consent for these application permissions:
    - DeviceManagementApps.Read.All
    - DeviceManagementManagedDevices.Read.All
    - User.Read.All
- Do **not** use Delegated Credentials for Intune autodiscovery jobs.

Recommended Steps:

1\. Create an app registration within the Azure portal on the same tenant where Intune resides.

- **Name:** Located in "Branding & properties"
- **Client ID and Secret:** Located in "Certificates & secrets"
- **API Permissions:**
    - Microsoft Graph application permissions listed above
    - Grant admin consent. See Azure [How to Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/grant-admin-consent)

2\. Take the values from 1b (Client ID & Secret)  and enter them into the Device42 job options:

- Enter the Azure application (client) ID into the discovery job **Client ID** field
- Enter the Azure secret value into the discovery job **Client Credential** field

### Intune Discovery Items

Intune discovery identifies mobile devices and mobile application software managed by Intune.

Scroll down to the bottom of the page to define a schedule for the Intune discovery job to run.

  }}
/>

Click **Save** to save the Intune discovery job.

### Intune OS Names

Intune OS data will take a lower precedence to the more authoritative sources like OS-level discovery. For example, the Device42 agent will pick up "Microsoft Windows 10 Enterprise" compared to the generic Intune name "Windows". The lower precedence ensures more detailed OS names are collected, enhancing the capability to filter the data.

### Renaming Intune Devices

Devices within Intune are renamed during the build process. If a device name is not being updated as expected following Device42 autodiscovery, or after being renamed and updated in Intune, select the **Overwrite existing device hostname with discovered hostname** option.
