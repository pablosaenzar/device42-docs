## Introduction

Device42 SNMP autodiscovery provides a new option for F5 load balancer discovery that returns discovered load balancers as both devices and Managed Resources. Discovering F5 load balancers as managed resources provides additional details about the load balancers and related resources that include resource maps that visually show the relationships between load balancers and their related resources. It also simplifies the chart view for Affinity Groups by visually presenting the servers underneath a load balancer.

The recommended best practice for Load balancer discovery is to first identify the devices using SNMP. This will identify the devices and associated resources. Next perform a Windows/*nix discovery of the back end resources to get more detailed inforamtion. Once you have the devices discovered you can then perform the API based "Load Balancer" discovery to link the devices correctly.

## Managed Resources Views

Discovered F5 load balancers are included in the Managed Resources list. Select _Resources > Managed Resources_ from the Device42 menu to display the list. See the [Managed Resources](https://docs.device42.com/auto-discovery/resources/) page for more information.

Click the _Vendor Resource Type_ filter drop-down and select _F5_ to display load balancer resources.

Click on a load balancer _Resource Name_ to see details about that load balancer. You can use the links in the panel on the right to see details about related resources.

Click _Resource Map_ at the top left of the page to see the topography map for the resource. You can select which _Resource Types_ you want to include in the map.

You will notice that the Chart views for Affinity Groups are now much simpler and easier to understand. Select _Applications > Affinity Groups_ to display the affinity group list.
