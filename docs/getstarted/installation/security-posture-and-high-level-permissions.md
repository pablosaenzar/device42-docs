The section outlines how Device42 ensures data security in transit and at rest, emphasizing the principle of least privilege in agentless discovery.

## Security Posture

- All data in transit from WDS to RC and RC to MA is over SSL or HTTPS.
- All data stays at rest within the MA in an end-user environment.
- Only data voluntarily shared by the end user leaves the premises.

## Required Permissions

Device42 uses the principle of least privilege in itâ€™s agentless discovery. For a detailed overview of permissions, please reference our Pre-requisites guide or please see the discovery section on our website and locate the relevant jobs for clarity on required permissions.
